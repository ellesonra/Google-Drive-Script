# Google Drive Export Scripts

This repository provides **two Python scripts** for downloading files from Google Drive:

- **`shared_drive_export.py`** ‚Äì For exporting files from a **Google Workspace Shared Drive**
- **`personal_folder_export.py`** ‚Äì For exporting files from a **personal Google Drive folder**

---

## üöÄ Overview

Google does not offer a direct method to export all contents of a Shared Drive or Personal Drive folder. These scripts fill that gap by using the Google Drive API to recursively download all files and folders to your local machine.

---

## üìÅ Which Script Should You Use?

| Use Case | Script | Required OAuth Scope |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| Shared Drive | `shared_drive_export.py` | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` (restricted) |
| Personal Folder | `personal_folder_export.py` | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` (not restricted) |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A Google Cloud Project with OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Google Drive API enabled
- `client_secret.json` OAuth credentials in the same directory as the script

---
